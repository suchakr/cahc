## Astronomy Starters

1. Use **[Stellarium](https://stellarium.org/)** interactively to understand
   - Location, Time, Co-ordinates, etc
   - Navigation, Zoom, etc
2. Understand **[Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/)** Usage
   - Understand the different co-ordinate systems and their transformations to each other
     - Equatorial, Ecliptic, Alt-Az, (Galactic)
   - Understand the different time systems and their transformations to each other
      - UTC, Local Time, Sidereal Time, Julian Day, Julian Date

## Astronomy Scripting
3. Write **Some Scripts** to Sun and Moon Equatorial Co-ordinates for span of days at few hours interval In **Stellarium** and In **Python Using Astropy**
   - Discuss any learnings from the exercise
   - Speed of Execution,  Ease of Programming, Difference is Julian Day and Julian Date, etc
  
4. Browse [Jean Meeus - Astronomical Algorithms - (1998)](https://www.scribd.com/document/444162160/Jean-Meeus-Astronomical-algorithms-1998-pdf)
5. Study and implement planet positions equations at
	http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html and 
	http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/tutorial.html
6. Check if the equations in the above link match with the ones in [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/)
