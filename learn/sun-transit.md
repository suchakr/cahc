## Abstract
VGJ is a text with about 5000 slokas (verses) spread over 64 aṅga (chapters). The text is a collection of verses and prose containing astral and other information including the observed motion of the sun, moon, gruhas, nakṣatras and seasons. 

Given the observations of the seasonal transit through nakṣatras in VGJ in Ādityacāra aṅga (11 aṅga, 1 adhyāya 11.1) and Ṛtusvabhāva aṅga ( 59.1 to 59.6 ) , we statistically estimate the date of the observations in text knowing the precession of the equinoxes. 


## The motion of the Sun
An observer, modern or ancient would notice the sun rises more in south-east during winter and in the north-east during summers.  There is a daily progress between the two extremes with the sun swinging from south to north and back is be called a seasonal cycle - a year.  The sun crosses the mid-point between the two extremes twice in one year. These four solar events in a year are called the equinoxes and winter solstice, spring equinox, summer solstice and autumn equinox respectively. The position of the stars in the early dawn sky corresponding to these four events are found in the text. These positions and their corresponding seasons help date the observations in the text.

## Nakṣatras
The night sky is adorned with stars - as if in a celestial shpere. Stars seem to rotate east and to west around a pivot position in the northern sky of the sphere as the night progresses. Stars closer to the pivot are always above the horizon even as they rotate around the pivot, while the further ones rise in the east and set in the. The belt of stars on the celestial sphere, on the cicrle perpendicular to the pivot is called nakṣatra mandala. This mandala is divided into 27 nakṣatras - each nakṣatra is a defined region with one or more taras. The motion of moon and gruhas (planets) are observed to be constrained to this mandala. 

## Sun and Seasons
Just prior to sun rise, when nakṣatras are visible, the nakṣatra on the eastern horizon can be thought to pulling the Sun to rise. The naskhatra last seen in the east prior to sunrise is an indicator of the season.

When the sun is at its southernmost , the nakṣatra prior to sunrise heralds the beginning of śiśir(winter) - considered to be beginning of a seasonal cycle. As the sun rise journeys south and then back to north covering the 27 nakṣatras, the start and end of the six seasons, namely śiśira, vāsanta, grīṣma, varṣā, śarat and hemanta are marked by different nakṣatra.  Each season can be thought to span 4.5 nakṣatras.

## Movement of the Seasonal Nakṣatra in VGJ
In Ādityacāra (11 aṅga, 1 adhyāya 11.1) , winter is observed to start from śraviṣṭhā while in Ṛtusvabhāva the start is past śraviṣṭhā. Similarly the end of summer is observed to be past āṣāḍha in Ādityacāra while in Ṛtusvabhāva it is before āṣāḍha. The movement of the seasonal nakṣatra in the text is shown in the table below.  It can be seen the seasonal nakṣatra markers between the two chapters have moved by  abound 0.5 nakṣatras .  This movement indicates the observations in the two chapters are from different epochs - attributable to precession.

|Season |Ādityacāra from | Ādityacāra to | Ṛtusvabhāva from | Ṛtusvabhāva to |
|---|---:|:---|---:|:---|
|śiśira |śraviṣṭhā | half-revati |pre śraviṣṭhā  | pūrva-bhādrā |
|vāsanta |half-revati | rohiṇī-end |revati |bharaṇī |
|grīṣma |mṛgaśīrṣa | half-āśleṣā |mṛgaśīrṣa | punarvasu|
|varṣā |half-āśleṣā | hasta| maghā |pūrva-phalgunī |
|śarat |citrā | half-jyeṣṭhā | citrā | viśākhā|
|hemanta |half-jyeṣṭhā | śravaṇa |jyeṣṭhā | pūrva-aṣāḍhā |

## Nakṣatra Mandala 
Each nakṣatra is a defined region with one or more taras. Vedic, Jaina and Baudha texts describe the nakṣatra in terms of astrograph and count of taras.  Kṛttikā , Rohiṇī, Svātī , Citrā , Jyeṣṭhā and few more are confidently identifiable based on the above text. Others, specially Dhaniṣṭhā (śraviṣṭhā) to Revatī have some uncertainities. Nevertheless   The nakṣatra mandala is shown below is a good fit of the nakṣatra mandala in the text.

## Dating using statistical methods
The rate of precession is well known and it causes the seasonal nakṣatras to move by about 0.5 nakṣatras every 500 years - about 1 degree every 71 years. In our approach, we first project the position of nakṣatras for a past many epochs.  Then we compute an error metric that indicates how far these nakṣatra positions are form the expected season described in the text, for each epoch.  The epoch that has the least error indicates the time period of the observations in the text.

We determine that the two chapters have observation of two different epochs -  Ādityacāra is placed aroud 1300 BCE and Ṛtusvabhāva 800 years later.

We also show that the text is layered assimilating later observation and insights as the text advances. Ṛtusvabhāva not only discusses the 12 months in addition to the 6 seasons of Ādityacāra , it also develops the notion of 12 solar months obviating the need to intercalery months needed in the earlier lunar reckoning .
