The history of the electronic text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This text has its origins in the work of Prof. Muneo Tokunaga of the
University of Kyoto. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Prof. Tokunaga
typed the entire text of the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata (BORI,
1933-66) into a computer, and in 1994 he placed the electronic text he had
thus created on the Internet. The enormity of the labour involved in the
creation of the text is matched only by Prof. Tokunaga's generosity in making
it so freely available to the scholarly world. This version of the text
derives ultimately from that first version, and I am deeply grateful to Prof.
Tokunaga for permitting this use of the products of his labour.

In transcribing the Mahabharata, Prof. Tokunaga took a number of policy
decisions which can cause difficulties for would-be users whose requirements
differ from his. Most of these -- for example, his use of “m” for both m and
anusvara, and “n” for the dental, palatal and velar nasals -- can be overcome
with a little effort. Much the most serious problem is caused by his use of a
single separator to divide word from word and compound-member from
compound-member (something he did not do in his transcription of the
Ramayana). The result is that, for example, the Gita begins <dharma kṣetre
kuru kṣetre>, not धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे.

In 1995 I devised a method which I believed would allow me to rejoin a
significant percentage of these “split” compounds. It involved using a
computer to analyse differences between substantial passages of
Mahabharata text before and after full “correction” by hand. In this
way the computer could learn to recognise large numbers of typical
split compounds, and could therefore be used to correct them wherever
they occurred in the text as a whole.

Applying this method over a period of months led to the elimination of perhaps
75% of the split compounds occurring in the electronic text; I also made large
numbers of corrections of other kinds. Then, like Prof. Tokunaga before me, I
made the resulting text available via the Internet; I also began to make use
of it in my own scholarly work. However, this kept its remaining deficiencies
all too permanently before my eyes, and I determined to find a way of bringing
the text to (notional) perfection.

With the aid of generous funding from the Humanities Research Board of the
British Academy, the Society for South Asian Studies and the Smuts Memorial
Fund (University of Cambridge), I was able to set up a project at BORI to
achieve this goal. A team of five assistants -- Indu Deshpande, Kirti Sharad
Thakar, Pradnya Anant Rayrikar, Samita Vasant Shinde and Shilpa Mulay -- were
employed to work through the entire text correcting any split compounds or
other errors they encountered. The task was done throughout in duplicate, so
that slips made by one assistant would show up through comparison with the
work of another. I was responsible for collating the results, which form the
basis of this electronic text.

For their dedicated work, and the levels of accuracy that they have brought to
a long and demanding task, the members of the team, like Prof. Tokunaga
himself, have earned the gratitude of all those who make use of the electronic
Mahabharata. My own gratitude goes in addition to Prof. Saroja Bhate, without
whose help the project would never have reached such successful results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The format of the electronic text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Line-numbers
---------------

The text is divided into eighteen files, one per main book (पर्वन्) of the
Mahabharata. However, the format of each line is such as to identify it
uniquely, whichever file it happens to come from. At the start of every line
appears a nine-character line-number specifying the book or पर्वन् (two
digits), the chapter or अध्याय (three digits), the verse or श्लोक (three
digits), and the quarter-verse or पाद (one letter, specifying the first of
the two पादs that form each line). Thus the first line of the Gita appears
as:

06023001a धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः

indicating that it represents पादs a and b of the first verse of book 6,
chapter 23.

If the line is part of a verse in त्रिष्टुभ् or other longer metre, the
division between the पादs is marked with a semicolon:

01001065a दुर्योधनो मन्युमयो महाद्रुमः; स्कन्धः कर्णः शकुनिस्तस्य शाखाः

If the line is part of a passage in prose, the final letter of the line-number
(which normally indicates the पाद) is capitalised:

01003001A जनमेजयः पारिक्षितः सह भ्रातृभिः कुरुक्षेत्रे दीर्घसत्रमुपास्ते

If the line is a header such as जनमेजय उवाच, the final letter of the
line-number is replaced by a space:

01045003  जनमेजय उवाच

2. Encodings
------------

The text is available in three encodings (character sets) commonly used for
Sanskrit and other Indian languages: Unicode Devanagari, Unicode Roman (using
the conventions defined in ISO 15919), and ASCII (using the Harvard/Kyoto
conventions).

3. Spelling conventions
-----------------------

It is impossible to achieve complete consistency in a text as large and
diverse as the Mahabharata, especially when it was edited over 33 years by
several different scholars from a vast range of manuscript sources. So, for
example, the spellings द्वंद्व and द्वन्द्व both appear in several books.
No serious attempt at normalisation of spelling has been made in the
electronic text, but some consistency in purely editorial matters is clearly
desirable, especially given that people will wish to search the entire text
for words and phrases. The following rules have been applied, which may
introduce minor changes from the text as printed; the words छत्र etc.
raise a particular problem which is addressed in some detail below.

  General rules
  +++++++++++++

  Forms such as किं चित् (/चन/अपि) are everywhere spelt as two words in
  Roman representations of the electronic text (assuming that sandhi does not
  prevent this, as in कापि), whatever the usage in the printed text;
  similarly किं स्वित्, etc. The word कच्चित् of course is unchanged, as are
  compounded forms such as किंचिच्छेष “having little left remaining”.

  In the Devanagari versions of the text, forms such as किंचित् are spelt as
  single words to respect normal usage in Indian scripts.

  The phrase अथ वा is always written as two words. The same applies to
  periphrastic perfects: कथयां बभूव, etc.

  Use of the word-internal अवग्रह in forms such as यशोऽर्थ is not
  entirely consistent in the printed text (e.g. यशोऽर्थं 7.86.20c but
  यशोर्थम् 8.29.25b). The Errata to Book 1 contain five such cases, in all
  of which Sukthankar requests the deletion of the अवग्रह (he missed a
  single further case at 1.115.11d). Arguments could be mounted against this
  practice, but the editorial intention is very clear, and the internal
  अवग्रह has been removed in the few cases where it does appear.

  An effort has been made to standardise the use of double अवग्रह in cases
  where the elided vowel is not अ but आ. This is the normal usage in the
  printed text, but there are a few cases where single अवग्रह appears
  instead; the electronic text corrects these.

  The words कार्त्तिक, कार्त्तिकेय, etc., are for the most part spelt with
  double “t” in the Critical Edition, but there are some occurrences of
  “कार्तिक” and “कार्तिकेय”. These have been silently normalised in the
  electronic text. Similarly, the absolutive छित्त्वा is occasionally spelt
  with a single “t”: such occurrences have been normalised to the correct
  form.


  The words छत्र, सत्र and पत्र
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  The words छत्र, सत्र and पत्र are spelt inconsistently in the
  Critical Edition: some editors favoured the spelling with single “t”, others
  that with double “tt”. It appeared undesirable to leave such inconsistency
  in place, and all three words are uniformly spelt with single “t” in the
  electronic text. This applies also to derivative forms in -in, etc. The
  choice of single over double “t” reflects the overall weight of opinion
  amongst the editors: this appeared a more important criterion than any
  questions of etymological “correctness”.

  Note, however, that the word तोत्त्र is spelt with double “t”, since the
  Critical Edition is entirely consistent in spelling it thus at every
  occurrence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes on the electronic text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Occasionally the electronic text corrects an error in the printed edition. The
following is a complete list of such corrections: each line is quoted as it is
actually printed, followed by a comment explaining the correction. (In a few
cases a possible correction is noted that has not in fact been implemented.)
Note that changes made purely to adhere to the spelling conventions listed
above are not included. Note also that all corrections included in the printed
edition's various lists of errata, etc., have been applied to the electronic
text: they too are not referred to here.

In these notes, “PAE” refers to Phillip Ernest, who has spent many hours
checking problematical readings in manuscripts used in the preparation of the
Critical Edition and still available for consultation at BORI. Thanks to his
efforts it has been possible to establish beyond doubt that certain puzzling
readings found in the printed edition are simple typographic errors.

01001046a भूतस्थानानि सर्वाणि रहस्यं विविधं च यत्
  The first printing of Book 1 (in separate fascicules) has त्रिविधं here,
  but in the second printing (in bound form) this has been replaced by
  विविधं. Since विविधं is also quoted as a variant reading, it is
  clear that it is the latter form which is a typographic error. I am grateful
  to James L. Fitzgerald for drawing my attention to this problem.

01001174c अजेयः परशुः पुण्ड्रः शम्भुर्देवावृधोऽनघः
  This is the only occurrence of the word शम्भु- spelt with nasal
  “m” rather than अनुस्वार. The spelling with अनुस्वार occurs
  seventeen times, including an occurrence later in Book 1 (01058043c).
  It is clear that this was the spelling preferred by Sukthankar and the
  other editors, and I have restored it in this one discrepant instance.
  I am grateful to James L. Fitzgerald for drawing my attention to this
  problem.
  
01058043a तमुवाच महाराज भूमिं भूमिपतिर्विभुः
  It is certain that तम् is a typographic error for ताम्. The editor
  records no variant readings for the word, and yet the Bombay Edition and
  manuscripts K0, Da1 and D1 all have ताम् (PAE).

01179009a केजिदाहुर्युवा श्रीमान्नागराजकरोपमः

02024018c उरगावासिनं चैव रोचमानं रणेऽजयत्
  See the Supplementary Addenda, p. 515.

05032014c विरोचतेऽहार्यवृत्तेन वीरो; युधिष्ठिरस्त्वयि पापं विसृज्य
  See the note on p. 726 of the edition.

05070042c प्रशान्ताः समभूताश्च श्रियं तानश्नुवीमहि
  It is certain that तान् is a typographic error for ताम्. The editor
  records no variant readings for the word, and yet the Bombay Edition and
  manuscripts K1, Ds1 and D5 all have ताम् (PAE).

07005034c त्रैय्यम्बकमथेष्वस्त्रमस्त्राणि विविधानि च
  त्रैय्यंबकम् is also quoted as a variant reading.

07035011a तमुदीक्ष्य तथा यान्तं सर्वे द्रोणपुरोगमाः
  “Coming” rather than “going” is necessary for the sense here.

07053014c उत्सहन्तेऽन्यथाकर्तुं प्रतिज्ञां सव्यसाचिनः
  Monier Williams allows अन्यथा-कृ- as a compound verb, but all the other
  ten occurrences of अन्यथा + verbal form of कृ- in the Mahabharata
  (01003133B, 01091013c, 03131015c, 03205010a, 05081053a, 07052011c,
  07172048a, 13043025a, 13047036a, 16009027c) are printed as non-compounds. Of
  these, seven consist of अन्यथा कर्तुम्, including two further occurrences
  of the पाद-phrase उत्सहन्ते ऽन्यथा कर्तुम्, one in the previous
  chapter (07052011c), the other later in the same parvan (07172048a). I am
  therefore preferring the non-compounded form.

07054005c प्रतिस्रोतःप्रवृत्ताश्च तथा गन्तुं समुद्रगाः
  Clearly a typographic error (cf. the almost identical 07167002c:
  प्रतिस्रोतः प्रवृत्ताश्च गन्तुं तत्र समुद्रगाः).

07054010a स्नुषा श्वश्व्रानघायस्ते विशोके कुरु माधव

07070037c सहसेनः सहामात्यो द्रापदेयानवारयत्

07076029a इति कृष्णा महेष्वासौ यशसा लोकविश्रुतौ

07079025c भूरिश्रवास्त्रिभिर्बाणैर्हेमपुङ्खः शिलाशितैः

07085021c अभ्यवर्षञ्शरैस्तीक्ष्णैः कङ्कबर्हिणवाजितः

07120069e अदृश्यौ च शरोघैस्तौ निघ्नतामितरेतरम्

07164037a तं सात्यकिः प्रत्यविद्धत्तथैव दशभिः शरैः
  It is certain that प्रत्यविद्धत् is a typographic error for
  प्रत्यविध्यत्. The editor records no variant readings for the word, and
  yet the Bombay Edition and manuscripts Dc1 and D6 both have प्रत्यविध्यत्
  (PAE).

07165044c महिमानं महाराज योगमुक्तस्य गच्छतः
  It is certain that योगमुक्तस्य is a typographic error for योगयुक्तस्य.
  The editor records no variant readings for the word, and yet the Bombay
  Edition, P. S. S. Sastri's edition of the southern recension and manuscripts
  Dc1, D5 and D7 all have योगयुक्तस्य (PAE).

07165055c पलायनकृतोत्साहा दुद्रुवुः सर्वतो दिशम्

08031004c युधिष्ठिरं चाभिभवन्नसपव्यं चकार ह
  It is certain that असपव्यं is a typographic error for अपसव्यं. The
  editor records no significant variant readings for the word, and yet the
  Bombay Edition and manuscripts K1, D4 and D8 all have अपसव्यं (PAE).

08062047c स वाजिसूतेष्वसनस्तथापत;द्यथा महावातहतो महाद्रुमः
  The line is unconstruable unless the initial स is taken as part of the
  following compound.

08065014c अथाब्रवीत्पाणिना पाणिमाघ्न;न्संदष्टाष्ठो नृत्यति वादयन्निव

08069017a यः स द्यूतजितां कृष्णां प्राह सत्पुरुषाधमः
  I believe this is a rather celebrated case, and I am grateful to Saroja
  Bhate for directing my attention to it.

09001052c समाश्वासयत क्षत्ता वचसा मधुरेण ह
  See Critical Notes.

09006023a एतच्छ्रुत्वा यथाभूतं कुरु माधव यत्क्षमम्
  See Critical Notes.

09016058e संन्यस्तकवचा देहैर्विपत्रायुधजीविताः
  This line has been reproduced unchanged as it appears in the printed
  edition; however, it seems likely that विपत्रायुधजीविताः is a
  typographic error for विपन्नायुधजीविताः, the reading found in the Bombay
  Edition and the manuscript D10. This reading is not recorded by the editor
  (though he does record other variants beginning with विपन्ना-). However,
  manuscript K2 does read विपत्रायुधजीविताः, so I do not feel justified in
  modifying the printed text. Manuscript information from PAE.

09018062c पुनरेवान्वर्तन्त पाण्डवानाततायिनः

10001050c श्लौकौ न्यायमवेक्षद्भिस्तत्त्वार्थं तत्त्वदर्शिभिः

11008039a भवान्कर्मपरो यत्र बुद्धिश्रेष्ठश्च भारत
  It is certain that कर्मपरो is a typographic error for धर्मपरो, as
  suggested by James L. Fitzgerald (The Mahabharata translated, vol. 7,
  Chicago and London, 2004, pp. 666-7). The editor records no variant readings
  for the word, and yet the Bombay Edition and manuscripts K1, K2 and D3 all
  have धर्मपरो (PAE).

12047006a एतैश्चान्यैर्मुनिगणर्महाभागैर्महात्मभिः

12089018a स्थानान्येतानि संगम्य प्रसङ्गे भूतिनाशनः
  This line has been reproduced unchanged as it appears in the printed
  edition; however, James L. Fitzgerald (The Mahabharata translated, vol. 7,
  Chicago and London, 2004, p. 740) suggests that प्रसङ्गे is an error for
  प्रसङ्गो. noting that this is the reading of the Citrasālā edition, but
  that no variants are recorded by the editor. It is also the reading of the
  Bombay Edition and manuscripts Da1 and Da2; however, manuscript K1 does read
  प्रसङ्गे, so I do not feel justified in modifying the printed text.
  Manuscript information from PAE.

12155004c तपसैव हि सिध्यन्ति तपो मूलं हि साधनम्
  I am grateful to James L. Fitzgerald for pointing out this error
  (तपोमूलं must be a बहुव्रीहि compound meaning “having asceticism for
  its basis”).

12244011a व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिर्मनोव्याकरणात्मकम्
  I am grateful to Kirti Sharad Thakar for pointing out this error.

12291043c योऽहं सोहऽमिति ह्युक्त्वा गुणाननु निवर्तते

12292027c दिवसान्ते गुणानेतानभ्येत्यैकोवतिष्ठति

12309024c ऋत्वास्यः समबलशुक्लकृष्णनेत्रो; मांसाङ्गो द्रवति वयोहयो नराणाम्
  It is certain that मांसाङ्गो is a typographic error for मासाङ्गो. The
  editor records no variant readings for the word, and yet the Bombay and
  Kumbakonam editions and manuscripts K1 and D4 all have मासाङ्गो (PAE). I am
  grateful to James L. Fitzgerald for pointing out this error.

12319002c पादात्प्रभृतिगात्रेषु क्रमेण क्रमयोगवित्
  I am grateful to James L. Fitzgerald for pointing out this error (प्रभृति
  when governed by the ablative पादात् must be an independent word).

12323057e परां गतिमनुप्राप्त इति नैष्ठिकमज्जसा

12324024c न क्षुत्पिपासे राजेन्द्र भूमेश्च्छिद्रे भविष्यतः

12331030a श्वेतदीपे मया दृष्टास्तादृशावृषिसत्तमौ

12331035c श्वेतदीपे त्वया दृष्ट आवयोः प्रकृतिः परा
  I am grateful to James L. Fitzgerald for pointing out this error.

12334014c एकान्तिनां शरणदोऽभयदो गतिदोऽस्तु वः; स मखभागहरस्त्रिगुणातिगः
12334015a चतुष्पञ्चधरः पूर्ते;ष्टयोश्च फलभागहरः
  I am grateful to Kirti Sharad Thakar and Samita Vasant Shinde for correcting
  what must be an editorial slip in the division of the text into पादs. The
  critical note says, “Very probably एकान्तिनां is a marginalia for वः and
  should not be regarded as part of the line”; however, the version adopted in
  the electronic text is clearly preferable.

12338005a इदं पुरुषसुक्तं हि सर्ववेदेषु पार्थिव

12342008c प्रोवाच वचनं श्लष्णं प्राज्ञो मधुरया गिरा

13016013a स दृष्ट्ववान्महादेवमस्तौषीच्च स्तवैर्विभुम्

13023006a न ब्राह्मणः साधयते हव्यं दैवात्प्रसिद्ध्यति

13027098c भजेद्वाचा मनसा कर्मणा च; भक्त्या युक्तः परया श्रद्धधानः

13028022a ततः संतापयामास बिबुधांस्तपसान्वितः

13059005a म्रियते याचमानो वै तमनु म्रियते ददत्
  This line has been reproduced unchanged as it appears in the printed text;
  however, it seems likely that the final word should appear as ऽददत्.

13061025a पितृंश्च पितृलोकस्थान्देवलोके च देवताः

13076007c क्लैशैर्विप्रं योऽफलैः संयुनक्ति; तस्यावीर्याश्चाफलाश्चैव लोकाः

13091001c भृग्वङ्गरसके काले मुनिना कतरेण वा

13101024c पितॄणां मानुषाणां च कान्तायास्त्वनुपूर्वशः

13110062a कलहंसविनिर्घोषैर्नूपूराणां च निस्वनैः

13125022c न भाति कालेऽभिहितं तेनासि हरिण कृशः

13134027c प्रवक्तॄन्पृच्छते योऽन्यान्स वै ना पदमर्च्छति
  This line has been reproduced unchanged as it appears in the printed text;
  however, as the editor's critical note observes, “नापदम्, that is <na
  āpadam> (for ना पदम्) is certainly more natural”.

14011010a व्याप्तास्वथासु वृत्रेण रसे च विषये हृते

14017035e तच्छ्रुत्वा नैष्ठिकीं बुद्धिं बुद्ध्येथाः कर्मनिश्चयात्

15005006a यच्चाहं पाण्डुपुत्रेण गुणवत्सु महात्मसु
  It is certain that पाण्डुपुत्रेण is a typographic error for पाण्डुपुत्रेषु.
  The editor records no variant readings for the word, and yet the Bombay
  Edition, P. S. S. Sastri's edition of the southern recension and manuscripts
  K3, K4 and D9 all have पाण्डुपुत्रेषु (PAE).

15033012a इयं च माता ज्येष्ठा मे वीतवाताध्वकर्शिता
  It is certain that वीतवाताध्वकर्शिता is a typographic error for
  शीतवाताध्वकर्शिता. The editor records no variant readings for
  वीत-, and yet the Bombay Edition, P. S. S. Sastri's edition of
  the southern recension and manuscripts K3, K4 and D9 all have
  शीतवाताध्वकर्शिता (PAE).

15044008a मा स्म शोके मनः कार्षीर्दिष्टेन व्यथते बुधः
  The sense demands दिष्टे न.

15044039c गम्यतां पुत्र मैव त्वं वोचः कुरु वचो मम
  It is certain that मैव is a typographic error for मैवं. The editor
  records no significant variant readings for the word, and yet the Bombay
  Edition and manuscripts K3, K4 and D9 all have मैवं (PAE).

16004004c ते सागरस्योपरिष्ठादवर्त;न्मनोजवाश्चतुरो वाजिमुख्याः

16008039a तत्सागरसमप्रख्यं वृष्णिचक्रं महर्धिमत्

16009012a पुनः पुनर्न मृश्यामि विनाशममितौजसाम्
  It is certain that मृश्यामि is a typographic error for मृष्यामि. The
  editor records no significant variant readings for the word, and yet the
  Bombay Edition and manuscripts K3, K4 and D9 all have मृष्यामि (PAE).

17001011a मातृभिः सह धर्मात्मा कृत्वोदकमतन्द्रितः
  It is certain that मातृभिः is a typographic error for भ्रातृभिः. The
  editor records no variant readings for the word, and yet the Bombay Edition
  and manuscripts K3, K4 and D9 all have भ्रातृभिः (PAE).

18001016c द्रौपद्याश्च परिक्लेशं न चिन्तयतुमर्हसि
  It is certain that चिन्तयतुम् is a typographic error for चिन्तयितुम्. The
  editor records no variant readings for the word, and yet the Bombay Edition
  and manuscripts K3, K4 and D8 all have चिन्तयितुम् (PAE).
